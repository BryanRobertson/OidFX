//! @brief        Class representing a group in a mesh
//!               
//!				  Each named group has its own section of the shared mesh index buffer,
//!               and its own effect. A group can only be drawn with one effect.
//!				  A mesh may have any number of groups, allowing a single mesh to be drawn
//!				  with many different effects
//!
